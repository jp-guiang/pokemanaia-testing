# Pokemanaia Testing

Pokemanaia (https://pokemanaia.herokuapp.com/) is the final group project that I was involved with, while studying at Dev Academy Aotearoa. This was our teams attempt at gamedev in a week. We chose to make a pokemon based game as it had a lot of learning new tech required to make it work, aswell as a lot of room for stretch and additional features we wanted to add.

The purpose of this personal project is to recreate the Home page feature of the game app, but to have more focus on testing the funcionality of the Home page. 
### What's included

This repo includes:

* a single, simple API endpoint (`/api/v1/fruits`)
* a single React component (`<App />`)
* an example database module (`server/db/fruits.js`)
* an API client module (`client/apis/fruits.js`)
* configuration for Jest and testing library
* configuration for server-side debugging in VS Code
* a single client-side test (`client/components/App.test.js`)
